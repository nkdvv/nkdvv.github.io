<p>Hello World! <br> My name is Nikki Davis. I am a current student and rower at OCC.<br>
           I have taken classes in fashion, design in everyday life, architecture, sculpture, and ceramics.<br>
          I was inspired to learn how to code after I saw an augumented reality exhibition by Jam Sutton.
